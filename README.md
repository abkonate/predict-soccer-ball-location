# Predicting Ball Location From Optical Tracking Data

The real-time prediction of the ball locationin a soccer match using the x and  y coordinatesof each player on the soccer field. The data is provided by an optical  tracking  system  developed  by start-up  company [Sentio  Sports  Analytics](https://sentiosports.com/). The predictions of this regressor were intended to be used in one of the Sentioâ€™s existing products. 

The project contains data analysis, features construction, model development and testing files written using python.

Project consists of 3 models:
* Game State Model (determines whether game is stopped or not) `Random Forest Classifier`
* Ball Location Prediction x-Axis `Random Forest Regressor`
* Ball Location Prediction y-Axis `Random Forest Regressor`

# Project Instructions

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository, and navigate to the downloaded folder.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/anaramirli/soccer-ball-tracker.git
    cd soccer-ball-tracker
    ```
    
2. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6 and the numpy package.

    * **Linux** or **Mac**:
    ```
    conda create --name my_env python=3.6
    source activate my_env
    ```
    
    * **Windows**:
    
    ```
    conda create --name my_env python=3.6
    activate my_env
    ```

3. Check requiremenets.
    ```
