# Predicting Ball Location From Optical Tracking Data

Model which is designed to predict ball location on the pitch during a soccer match using players' and referee's spatiotemporal data by utilizing machine learning algorithms.

Project consists of 3 model:
* Game State Model (determines whether game is stopped or not) `Random Forest Classifier`
* Ball Location Prediction x-Axis `Random Forest Regressor`
* Ball Location Prediction y-Axis `Random Forest Regressor`



In this repository you will find all the data analysis, dataset construction, model development and testing notebooks written using jupyter notebooks and python.

* `src` directory to view `README.md` file describing the notebooks and their structure.
