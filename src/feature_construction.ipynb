    "### What dataset do we use?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document, given an entire 2017-2018 season's worth of player data from the The Süper Lig, Turkish professional soccer league (≈1,700,000 data points), we generate input (aligning player trajectories based in role and then setting new features based on spatiotemporal data) and output data in order to build model for predicting ball location over the pitch.\n",
    "Due to losses in data, some matches have been extracted, so the total number of matches used is 299.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is our approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach is based on the player's role-assignment, rather than the player's individual data. We're given huge set of player spatiotemportal tracking dats. In oreder to build our features set, we should arrange all these data in some particular order, so machine should understand which data it use. We can not randomly pick player's data and use it in data construction. Therefore, using players individual data for analyzing lacks some important contextual concepts.  Football is played by 11 players on each side, but there is an open door for 3 substitution players. We can not also use players' data those aren't in the game, this should cause a lot of noise in the system. For doing so, we developed the role-based analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in all games, football also has its standard rules for assigning each player role, such as; the rearmost players are defence players, midfielders are players whose position of play is midway, forwards player. Using this information we can assig role to each player.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define which player's in the game.\n",
    "2. Generate players' average positions based on their position in the timeline of previous 15 minutes.\n",
    "3. Each minute update their average position.\n",
    "4. Scale average positions to 105x68 pitch size based on their standard deviation of distributional data.\n",
    "5. Assing role to each player.\n",

    "<br><img src=\"scaling.png\" alt=\"scaling-before\" title=\"scaling-before\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we lost player's data, even though he is still in the game (not substituted or set-off). This happens when tagger misses to tag data, the player receives medical treatment out of the pitch, or game is stopped (in this case all players data is null). In this praticualr cases we allply below.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Chenck wheter player is still in game or not (not substituted or set-off).\n",
    "2. If player's in game check wheter you're receiving his data or not.\n",
    "3. If we receive his data then use it in the feature construction."
