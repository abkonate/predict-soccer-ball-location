###feature_analysis.ipynb

In this notebook, we analyse player coordinate data by plotting various simple features such as average, maximum and minimum coordinates, group speeds, sprint player coordinates, referee position, etc. We try to find relations between outliers or patterns in these features and the events we wish to predict. Additionally, we postulate ideas about how each related feature family can be effective in predicting certain events.
